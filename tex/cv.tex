\section*{Research}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
  \item \textbf{McGill University}, August 2022 -- Present
    \begin{itemize}
      \item I investigated techniques to mechanize substructural languages via higher-order abstract syntax in the proof assistant Beluga. One approach~\cite{Sano23oopsla} led to a mechanization of session types, which have a linear type system. I also advised many student projects that used this technique. I also worked on an alternate approach that later led to a general framework for mechanizing a whole suite of substructural languages~\cite{Zackon25cpp}.
      \item I am investigating language interoperability between languages with substantially different semantics, e.g., functional programming and session-typed process calculi. I develop a notion of first-class code that enables a functional language to generate, analyze, and run process calculus code~\cite{Sano25icfp}. I am generalizing this approach to capture interactions between functional languages and a broader set of languages, including an assembly-like language and a quantum programming language.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Max Planck Institute for Software Systems}, September 2023 -- October 2023
    \begin{itemize}
      \item As a visiting researcher, I worked on extending session types with probability (no publications) and metaprogramming~\cite{Sano25icfp}.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Carnegie Mellon University} August 2018 -- October 2021
    \begin{itemize}
      \item I extended the CC0 compiler, a C-like language extended with session-typed concurrency, with monitors. I extended the theory of monitors to support shared session types and formalized it in my thesis~\cite{Sano19ms}
      \item I extended shared session types with subtyping~\cite{Sano21coordination}, enabling the static encoding of shared protocols with ``phases,'' i.e., protocols that can be encoded in a (finite) state machine.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{University of Massachusetts Lowell}, \emph{Robotics Research Group} September 2016 -- May 2017
    \begin{itemize}
      \item I developed a ROS-based service that receives a top-down image of a robot and its surroundings to simulate laser scan outputs done by the robot. This was used in conjunction with TinyRobo, a swarm robot project.
      \item I implemented a real time FaceDetector for GoogleGlass using OpenCV and Android NDK, and then optimized it by devising a handoff mechanism between generic Android devices through first class continuations.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{University of Massachusetts Lowell}, \emph{Center for Internet Safety and Forensic Education and Research} August 2015 -- May 2018
    \begin{itemize}
      \item I surveyed various consumer phones with stereocameras and conducted experiments to determine their attack capabilities~\cite{Li17icc}.
      \item I researched common IR-based products and their protocols. This led to a proposing of a few attack models and the designing of low-cost devices that bridge IR and IoT devices~\cite{Sano18wasa}.
      \item I maintained and enhanced the Privacy Enhancing Keyboard application for Android based on usability experiments~\cite{Ling17wasa, Ling17wcmc}.
