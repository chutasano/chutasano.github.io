abstract = {Session types have emerged as a powerful paradigm for structuring communication-based programs. They guarantee type soundness and session fidelity for concurrent programs with sophisticated communication protocols. As type soundness proofs for languages with session types are tedious and technically involved, it is rare to see mechanized soundness proofs for these systems.We present an executable intrinsically typed small-step semantics for a realistic functional session type calculus. The calculus includes linearity, recursion, and recursive sessions with subtyping. Asynchronous communication is modeled with an encoding.The semantics is implemented in Agda as an intrinsically typed, interruptible CEK machine. This implementation proves type preservation and a particular notion of progress by construction.},

While the foundation of type systems for the functional core of programming languages often builds on the proposition-as-types correspondence, automatically ensuring strong safety and liveness properties, imperative features have mostly been handled by extra-logical constructions. Our system crucially builds on the integration of nondeterminism and sharing, inspired by logical rules of differential linear logic, and ensures session fidelity, progress, confluence and normalisation, while being able to handle first-class shareable reference cells storing any persistent object. We also show how preservation and, perhaps surprisingly, progress, resiliently survive in a natural extension of our language with first-class locks. We illustrate the expressiveness of our language with examples highlighting detailed features, up to simple shareable concurrent ADTs.},

abstract="Linear type systems need to keep track of how programs use their resources. The standard approach is to use context splits specifying how resources are (disjointly) split across subterms. In this approach, context splits redundantly echo information which is already present within subterms. An alternative approach is to use leftover typing [2, 23], where in addition to the usual (input) usage context, typing judgments have also an output usage context: the leftovers. In this approach, the leftovers of one typing derivation are fed as input to the next, threading through linear resources while avoiding context splits. We use leftover typing to define a type system for a resource-aware {\$}{\$}{\backslash}pi {\$}{\$}$\pi$-calculus [26, 27], a process algebra used to model concurrent systems. Our type system is parametrised over a set of usage algebras [20, 34] that are general enough to encompass shared types (free to reuse and discard), graded types (use exactly n number of times) and linear types (use exactly once). Linear types are important in the {\$}{\$}{\backslash}pi {\$}{\$}$\pi$-calculus: they ensure privacy and safety of communication and avoid race conditions, while graded and shared types allow for more flexible programming. We provide a framing theorem for our type system, generalise the weakening and strengthening theorems to include linear types, and prove subject reduction. Our formalisation is fully mechanised in about 1850 lines of Agda [37].",

Connectivity graphs are parametric in their vertices (representing entities like threads and channels) and their edges (representing references between entities) with labels (representing interaction protocols). We prove deadlock and memory leak freedom in the style of progress and preservation and use separation logic as a meta theoretic tool to treat connectivity graph edges and labels substructurally. To prove preservation locally, we distill generic separation logic rules for local graph transformations that preserve acyclicity of the connectivity graph. To prove global progress locally, we introduce a waiting induction principle for acyclic connectivity graphs. We mechanize our results in Coq, and instantiate our method with a higher-order binary session-typed language to obtain the first mechanized proof of deadlock and leak freedom.},

abstract = {Languages with support for metaprogramming, like MetaOCaml, offer a principled approach to code generation by guaranteeing that well-typed metaprograms produce well-typed programs. However, many problem domains where metaprogramming can fruitfully be applied require generating code in languages like C, CUDA, or assembly. Rather than resorting to add-hoc code generation techniques, these applications should be directly supported by explicitly heterogeneous metaprogramming languages.We present MetaHaskell, an extension of Haskell 98 that provides modular syntactic and type system support for type safe metaprogramming with multiple object languages. Adding a new object language to MetaHaskell requires only minor modifications to the host language to support type-level quantification over object language types and propagation of type equality constraints. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach through three object languages: a core ML language, a linear variant of the core ML language, and a subset of C. All three languages support metaprogramming with open terms and guarantee that well-typed MetaHaskell programs will only produce closed object terms that are well-typed. The essence of MetaHaskell is captured in a type system for a simplified metalanguage. MetaHaskell, as well as all three object languages, are fully implemented in the mhc bytecode compiler.},

abstract = {Priority Sesh is a library for session-typed communication in Linear Haskell which offers strong compile-time correctness guarantees. Priority Sesh offers two deadlock-free APIs for session-typed communication. The first guarantees deadlock freedom by restricting the process structure to trees and forests. It is simple and composeable, but rules out cyclic structures. The second guarantees deadlock freedom via priorities, which allows the programmer to safely use cyclic structures as well.  Our library relies on Linear Haskell to guarantee linearity, which leads to easy-to-write session types and more idiomatic code, and lets us avoid the complex encodings of linearity in the Haskell type system that made previous libraries difficult to use.},

abstract = {We introduce MetaML, a statically-typed multi-stage programming language extending Nielson and Nielson's two stage notation to an arbitrary number of stages. MetaML extends previous work by introducing four distinct staging annotations which generalize those published previously [25, 12, 7, 6]We give a static semantics in which type checking is done once and for all before the first stage, and a dynamic semantics which introduces a new concept of cross-stage persistence, which requires that variables available in any stage are also available in all future stages.We illustrate that staging is a manual form of binding time analysis. We explain why, even in the presence of automatic binding time analysis, explicit annotations are useful, especially for programs with more than two stages.A thesis of this paper is that multi-stage languages are useful as programming languages in their own right, and should support features that make it possible for programmers to write staged computations without significantly changing their normal programming style. To illustrate this we provide a simple three stage example, and an extended two-stage example elaborating a number of practical issues.},
